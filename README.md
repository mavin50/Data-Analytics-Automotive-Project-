Companies across the used-car market’s value chain can use data and analytics to tap into growth opportunities and improve margins. As used-car companies emerge from complicated market dynamics caused by the pandemic, they have been thrust into a new and complex environment, contending with changing consumer preferences, evolving supply-and-demand dynamics, and economic pressures. These influences will make it more difficult for players across the used-car ecosystem to grow and will increase pressure to maintain elevated margins from the pandemic period.
To tap into customer demand, protect margins, and improve performance, companies across the used-car value chain—namely B2B and B2C dealers, OEMs, and financing and leasing companies—must reinvent and redesign business approaches to be more analytically savvy if they want to stay ahead of the competition.
Using a dataset about the India’s used car industry, we want to uncover insights and make appropriate recommendations with top performing brands that resonate with the market’s needs in the city of Chennai.
